Unified base for Flutter applications based on [special architecture](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNJVBM3o=/?share_link_id=771428578014)

## Features

For now includes:
* Analysis options
* Logger base on [Logger](https://pub.dev/packages/logger)

## Analysis options

Create an `analysis_options.yaml` file at the root of the package (alongside 
the `pubspec.yaml` file) and `include: application_base/analysis_options.yaml` 
from it.

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.
#
# Additional information about this file can be found at
# https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options
#
# Full list of rules can be fount at https://dart.dev/tools/linter-rules
#
# To get a preview of the proposed changes run
